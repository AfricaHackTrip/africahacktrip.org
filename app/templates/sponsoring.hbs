    What’s the Deal?
  </h2>

  <p>
    AfricaHackTrip is about tech communities. We want to connect people and share knowledge. Doing business is not a primary goal so the participants will spend their private time and money. Because it's going to be fun and we believe we can do something good for the tech scene. Partners help us lower the costs, host more events for more people and produce a better movie. We want to focus more on preparing and organizing the trip and less on earning money to pay for it.
  </p>

  <p>
    AfricaHackTrip will organize four hack events in four locations reaching hundreds of developers. At the end of our trip we will be present at
    <a href="http://www.demo-africa.com/">
      DEMO Africa
    </a>
    the continent's largest startup event. We will be filming throughout our journey and release a documentary about our experiences when we get back.
  </p>

  <p>
  The events or our movie might be your spot. We are happy to mention our partners and place their logos in any published material. As our sponsor you will be visible to everyone we meet: startups, developers and other forward-thinking people in a new market with huge growth potential. 
  <strong>And we send HighFives and Hugs your way <3</strong>
