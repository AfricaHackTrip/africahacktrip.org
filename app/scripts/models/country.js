It may not be the fastest growing city in Africa, but it is home to a Creative Class, made up of Kenyans and expatriates alike, many of them working in ICT. From what we've heard so far, the city buzzes and hums with hacktivity.</p><p>In 2012, Kenya's ICT Board conceptualized a 5-year-plan to see ICT contribute 25% of the GDP and thus make Kenya a \"digital nation\". Key to this transition is innovation. More and more innovation takes place in hubs, where entrepreneurs cowork on finding solutions for local problems.</p><p>We are Ã¼berexcited to come to Nairobi and meet the local hackers!</p>",

In Kampala, government and private sector join hands in fostering ICT. The sector is growing rapidly and so are incubation centers like Outbox and Hive Colab, where young people come up with practical solutions for local problems. We can't wait to meet some serious hackers in Kampala!</p>",
