    intro: "<p>Nairobi is East Africa's economic and innovation center. It may not be the fastest growing city in Africa, but it is home to a Creative Class, made up of Kenyans and expatriates alike, many of them working in ICT. From what we've heard so far, the city buzzes and hums with hacktivity.</p><p>In 2012, Kenya's ICT Board conceptualized a 5-year-plan to see ICT contribute 25% of the GDP and thus make Kenya a \"digital nation\". Key to this transition is innovation. More and more innovation takes place in hubs, where entrepreneurs cowork on finding solutions for local problems.</p><p>We are Ã¼berexcited to come to Nairobi and meet the local hackers!</p>",
